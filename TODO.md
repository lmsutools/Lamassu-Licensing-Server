# BASIC FEATURES
Extend the licenses and products tables to include activation_date and creation_date columns, which store the dates when a license is activated and created, respectively.

Implement a scheduled task (e.g., a cron job or a background worker) that automatically changes a license's state to 'expired' once its expiration_date is reached.

Modify the API endpoint for license activation to check the current state of the license. If the state is anything other than 'inactive', return a response message stating the state of the license (e.g., 'expired').

If the license to be activated using the API endpoint is already active, return a response with the message "License is already active" and disallow the activation.

Implement a feature that allows license holders to deactivate their licenses. This can be useful in scenarios where they need to transfer the license to another device or user.

Rate limiting:
Add rate limiting to the API endpoints to prevent abuse and protect the system from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

License validation endpoint:
Add an API endpoint that allows clients to validate their licenses periodically. This can help enforce the licensing restrictions and prevent unauthorized use.

# ADVANCED FEATURES
Support for multiple license types:
Support different types of licenses, like time-limited, feature-limited, and user-limited licenses. This will allow software developers to offer different licensing options to their customers.

Implement a webhook system that notifies software developers when a license is activated, deactivated, or updated. This will help them keep track of their licenses and manage their products more effectively.

Add a user management system to the platform, enabling software developers to create and manage user accounts for their customers. This will allow developers to assign licenses to specific users and provide better customer support.

Create an API endpoint for checking the validity of a license without activating it. This can be useful for scenarios where software developers want to verify the license status before allowing the software to run.

Add analytics and reporting capabilities to the platform, enabling software developers to gain insights into their products' usage, licenses sold, and other relevant information.

Audit trails:
Implement an audit trail system to track all license-related activities like activation, deactivation, and changes in license states. This can be useful for compliance and to investigate any potential issues.

Email notifications:
Send email notifications to users when their licenses are about to expire or when they have successfully activated or deactivated their licenses.
# SECURITY MEASURES
After analyzing your code, I found several security holes and have some recommendations to patch them.

Insecure database credentials: The database credentials are hardcoded in db.js. This exposes sensitive information like the password, which could be exploited by an attacker.

Recommendation: Use environment variables or a separate configuration file to store sensitive data, and don't include them in the source code.

SQL Injection: Raw SQL queries are used in several places without proper parameterization or escaping, which leaves the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Recommendation: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks.

Missing input validation: There is no input validation for user-provided data in the command-line interface or API endpoints. This allows attackers to perform malicious actions such as code injection.

Recommendation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent code injection and other malicious actions.

Missing rate limiting: The API does not have rate limiting, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks or flood the server with requests.

Recommendation: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

Insecure HTTP: The application is served over HTTP, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Recommendation: Serve the application over HTTPS using a TLS certificate.

No authentication/authorization: There is no authentication or authorization implemented in the application. Anyone can access and manipulate the data.

Recommendation: Implement authentication and authorization to protect sensitive endpoints and actions.

No Content Security Policy (CSP): The application does not implement a Content Security Policy, making it susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Recommendation: Implement a Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS risks.

Outdated packages: Some dependencies in package.json are outdated, which may contain known security vulnerabilities.

Recommendation: Update dependencies to their latest versions and regularly check for updates.

No error handling: The application does not have proper error handling, which can lead to information disclosure or unexpected behavior.

Recommendation: Implement proper error handling and return appropriate error messages to the user.

No security headers: The application does not set security headers such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, or X-XSS-Protection.

Recommendation: Set security headers to protect the application from certain types of attacks.
